      <p>My name is Yi Tao, currently a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh. I want to learn more about the interaction between front-end and back-end API
      since I made a small full-stack project during this winter break as an interview for the HARI lab at Pitt I mentioned in the resume.
      I used Angular 11 and Bootstrap in <a href="https://github.com/AaronTao16/clinicalReminderSystem-DashBoard">front-end (GitHub)</a>,
      ionic 5 in <a href="https://github.com/AaronTao16/ClinicalReminderSystem-Mobile">mobile (GitHub)</a>,
      and Spring MVC as <a href="https://github.com/AaronTao16/clinicalReminderSystem-Backend">back-end (GitHub)</a> and deployed on Heroku.
      This is the first time I finished a relatively complete project like this in three weeks, it's like opening the door to the software world.
      Before that, I thought I liked programming just because I enjoy solving problems, but after all of these, I believe I love it! Programming is a kind of artwork,
      whether website page design, data display in front-end or api design in back. Creating  software that makes monotonous data to understandable and meaningful displays with a beautiful feature for customers or users is what I want to do most.
      I wish I can make other's life more convenient and colorful using my skills. In this internship, I think I can learn many more interesting tools and excellent skills as I wish.</p>
