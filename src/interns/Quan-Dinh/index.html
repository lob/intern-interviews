        <p>My name is Quan Dinh, a CS Junior at the University of Texas at Dallas. I interned last summer at RealPage,
            Inc., which specialized in making data analytics software for real estate companies. I attended several
            hackathons before COVID-19 and won 1st place at HackUTD 2019 for making Alexa skills.</p>
        <p>For an internship, I would love to learn about the company's technology stack. I also love to learn from
            mentors, professionals with years of valuable experience who can teach me much more than what school has to
            offer. </p>
        <p>I want to become a software engineer because I have been fascinated by technology for a long time. I
            dream of making software that can impact a large group of people. Becoming a software engineer intern at
            a great company is a vital step toward that dream.</p>

    <div id="lower-part">This picture is one of the most meaningful to me. This is my team demoing our product at UT
        Dallas's hackathon.
        Prior to this hackathon, I've been to other hackathons with friends, but we never had a product to show. </p>
        <p>At
            HackUTD 2019, I was able to find these wonderful teammates. It was really fun getting to know them through
            brainstorming, coding, eating, and just talking together. It was a memorable weekend and this
            picture really captured it: us having a laugh together while demoing our product for the judges.
