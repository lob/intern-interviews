                        learning?</h5>

                        <!-- <h5 class="card-title">Special title treatment</h5> -->
                        <p class="card-text">For me, I feel that an internship should provide two closely related
                            things. First, I feel that an
                            internship
                            should allow me to work on meaningful projects and gather work experience. Obviously, that's
                            what
                            everyone looks for.<br> <br>
                            Beyond that I look for a place that allows me to grow and supports my transformation from an
                            intern to a
                            college graduate
                            navigating the confusing workforce. Looking at the Lob blog I see a company that is always
                            looking
                            within, and always
                            looking to improve through constructive critism. <br> <br>A great example found in the blog
                            was
                            taking a look at
                            the old,
                            original company logo to see what improvements could be made, and pointing them out openly.
                            For me, that shows me that I will fit in because I know my opnions and my critique will be
                            valued.

                        to create?</h5>
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p class="card-text">My interesting in wanting to be a Software Engineer is a long story. When I
                            was a kid, I fell in love
                            with building and creating
                            new designs with Legos. In high school, I took my passion for design and tried a computer
                            science class.
                            I instantly fell in love with it.
                            I loved the idea of getting to write a set of simple instructions that could do some complex
                            things. At
                            that time, I was trying to learn
                            how to create a small animation in java. Seeing all my hard work coming together to create
                            even a small
                            animation amazed me. Since then,
                            I've been obsessed with learning different concepts and theories about this field. Another
                            thing I love
                            about Computer Science is the fact that
                            its an ever growing field, every day there are new things to learn and new improvements to
                            be made to
                            existing creations and the ability to
                            wake up everyday and learn about some of these things is what keeps me going.

                            Personally, I love to work full stack because I get to work on software that people see, and
                            sometimes
                            don't see. But if you need a more
                            specific answer, I would love to work on the backend, getting to work and create the gears
                            that keep
                            Lob.com's gears running :)
