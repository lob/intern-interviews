      <p> Hi there! I'm Tommy Ly, a junior studying Computer Science at California State University of Los Angeles
        (CSULA). I will become a senior once this spring semester is finished.
      </p>
      <p> I've been working hard to get an internship as a software engineer or really anything to help me learn and
        grow in the Computer Science field. The main things I want to learn from internships is how to work as a team
        with efficient communication. I also want to learn how the software engineering process happens and see it in
        person because I strongly believe that this is a skill that can be applied to other fields of Computer Science
        and it will definitely help me expand my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p> I chose software engineering over all the many fields that Computer Science offers because I like the
        challenges that software engineering provides. It forces you to have a different mindset compared to other
        fields and it interests me the most because I like designing programs, whether it be the user interface or the
        back-end code. As for softwares that I want to create, I don't have any specific in mind because my main goal to
        simply learn and absorb my experiences during an internship.
