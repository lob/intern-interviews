                <h1>What I Want To Learn</h1>
                <p>
                    I was deeply attracted by LOB and this position once I saw it as this opportunity 
                tightly matches my career goal and my sharpest skills. I believe I will be able to 
                both learn and contribute a lot to this team. 
                <p></p>
                    In the age of big data, my grandparents has been hurt many times by scams caused 
                by data leakage,  because handling those virtual manipulations and ditinguish massive 
                informations online were too hard for them. I know there are many people like them. 
                <p></p>
                    Since then, I was always determined to be a software engineer. I want to automate 
                and simplify those daily online manipulations, to make everyone capable to enjoy the 
                online world with ease, instead of being abandon by this age of informations. 
                <p></p>
                    For example, mail management simplification is defintely one of the most important issue 
                this years. Fortunatelly, LOB is definitely making this idea comes true. I was deeply 
                impressed by how its API automated the email sending, tracking and routing in such a huge
                scale. 
                <p></p>
                    As a software engineer, I deeply understand such a powerful and popular product must 
                be supported by strong database management, advanced UI design skills and a machine learning 
                algorithm, and I also know LOB is looking for employees fluent on those skills. 
                Luckily, those skills were exactly what I always try to learn and kept on sharpening 
                during my previous expeirences, because I believe those skills are fundamental for my goal of 
                simplifying the connection between online and offline worlds. What's more, LOB even provides
                the chance to directly impact on the product during the internship. If I am allowed to
                contribute to this product, I believe it will be a huge step for me towards my goal.
                <p></p>  
                    Thereforem I cannot wait to apply and join this team. I firmly believe this will be 
                an unforgettable expereince and my zeal and skills will make dedications to the LOB family.
