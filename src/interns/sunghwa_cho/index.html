            <p> The first thing I would like to mention is that I appreciate this fun Code Challenge. 
              I enjoyed doing the Code Challenge.</p>
            <p> I want to gain real workplace experience where I can't experience at school. 
              I believe it is a great opportunity to gain some taste of this field before I dive into it. 
              I like to experience web programming which is an essential business, especially for this pandemic.
               On top of it, I want to see how I can apply my knowledge that I have gained from school to work. </p>
            <p>One of the reasons that I want to be a software engineer is that I like coding. 
              I like to see the changes because of the lines of code that I write.  
              This is the biggest reason that I choose this field. 
              I would like to create or work on a Web or a mobile application because I want to see people using software or application that I create. </p>
