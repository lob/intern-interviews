            <p> I would love to learn more and gain practical experience in building APIs during this internship,
                especially
                under a company that has a multitude of experience in the creation of APIs such as the Lob Mail API.
                More specifically, I'd like to get my hands on working on projects that positively affect the real
                world, all while
                improving upon my coding skills in building front end applications with React or working backend with
                databases. After my time from this internship and the experience gained from it, I would like to repeat
                the
                cycle
                and build even more complex applications that hopefully many others would benefit from.
