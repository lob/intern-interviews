                Hello!
                I’m Tony Attalla, a student finishing my 3rd year at the University of Toronto.

                <b> About the photo:</b> This is from the first NBA game I had the opportunity to go to. Me and my
                friend Michael
                arrived early so we got to take some photos before the game. This game happened in December 2019. Even
                though we lost,
                this photo
                is important to me, now more than ever, since it was taken just a few months before the world
                collapsed. I'm on the left.

                <b> About me:</b> When I first started studying software engineering, I had the same
                vision as many other teenage boys who
                go into programming related fields: I wanted to make video games. However, when I actually entered the
                industry, I quickly found where my interests actually are. I noticed that when I was on my previous
                internships, I always felt proud when I would complete a project that helped make other people’s work
                easier. I would receive emails the day after release talking about how I’ve saved some department so
                much time or how easy my app was to use, and that is what really excites me about software engineering,
                It’s an opportunity to be creative in order to make something that people enjoy using.

                <b> What I want out of an internship:</b> For this particular internship, I’d like to apply my skills in
                full stack development (Frontend and backend
                engineering, database design and writing queries), but I also want to pick up some new technologies. I’m
                fortunate to
                have learned about fields like cloud computing and distributed systems in school and on my free time,
                but it would be great for me to apply my knowledge in an industry setting, since they’re huge parts of
                the software engineering space.
