        Hi, I am Chia-Ying Lin. I like new technologies and robotics and that's why I choose to become a 
        software engineer. As a passionate learner, absorbing new knowledge, meeting different people and 
        brain-storming is what I love. During my last internship, I learned front-end skills by myself and 
        used Redux and React.Js to develop a website to demonstrate the data I analyzed. I combined my deep 
        learning knowledge and front-end technologies to visualize the data.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I am optimistic and enjoy communicating with people from different fields. Also, my excellent leadership 
        allows me to be an outstanding leader in the Student Association of my department. My job there is to 
        negotiate with the biggest company in Taiwan, TSMC, for their sponsorship, which strengthens my communication 
        ability.
      </p>
      <p> 
        In college, I obtained powerful research and self-learning skills when researching machine learning and 
        deep learning such as LSTM, CNN, facial recognition and natural language processing. After that, 
        I want to be familiar with back-end development so I take a Cloud Computing course semester. This summer, 
        I want to accumulate my experience about the back-end to become a full-stack engineer. Also, I believe work 
        in the US will be a brand new experience. I really look forward to meeting varieties of people and becoming 
        good friends with them.
