      <p>There are a lot of things I would like to learn from this internship. I want to learn more what it is like serving clients' needs and what it means to be. I am more familiar with ReactJS and Ruby on Rails. So, this internship would be a good opportunity for me to learn languages and apply the languages to real-world situation. As a developer, I spent a lot of time using API for my database. I am curious how it is like behind the scenes.  I want to be a better programmer.</p>
      <p>I want to be a software engineer because I want to create new products for people. I want to change clients' vision into a real product that anyone can see online. I feel like anything's possible. Quoting from "Ratatouille", "Anyone can cook." And I am sure as long as you have a goal and ambition to achieve what you want, anyone can do it. I also love the tech community and people are in general very inclusive and helpful. In the future, I would like to create more general purpose software, like Adobe and Microsoft. Anything that can target to the general public and something they can use in their daily lives.</p>
