          Hello, I am Neel Suthar, currently pursuing a master's degree in
          computer science at The University of Texas at Arlington. Coming to
          the United States for higher education was a wonderful journey for me.
          I got astonishing experiences along the way and performed my most
          excellent in all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Till now, I learned technologies like Java, ReactJS, Python,
          Databases, and many others. As an intern, I want to learn in-depth
          about the development process of real-world products. I want to be a
          part of the experience that helps me to connect my existing skills.
          Enhancing my front-end and back-end knowledge to build scalable
          products. I want to apply my skills to develop all kinds of
          applications utilized for better use. I want to be a part of a team
          that builds products that help businesses and individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my journey, I want to help create complex, real-world, and
          stand-out products that users can use with the utmost satisfaction,
          and doing so will help me increase my abilities. I want to be a part
          of an organization where I can apply my abilities to grow with the
          organizations and help create better solutions. I can quickly switch
          between technologies that give me the absolute skill and believe it
          will help me grasp things better.
