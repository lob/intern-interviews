      <p>My name is Henry Gardner and I am a Junior at the University of Rochester. I am pursuing a triple major in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics.  </p>
      <p>I am seeking an internship, more specifically at Lob, because I am looking for hands-on experience with a diverse and well organized team. At Lob, you seek candidates that are data-driven, able to work in a team environment and individually, and are willing and eager to explore new ways to solve problems and develop solutions. This is exactly who I am. </p>
      <p>As a workshop leader and teaching assitant for several Computer Science courses, I have developed a unique ability to work in a collaborative enviornment from both the student and teaching perspectives. After recieving excellent reviews approaching my 3rd semester as a workshop leader, I am more than ready to dive into the real world working along side some of the brightest minds to increase the connectivity of businesses. </p>
      <p>I have had a wonderful time learning many different programming languages used for many different purposes. Some of the languages that I have experience using in both individual and team enviornments are the following:</p>
      <div class="ul">
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>C</li>
          <li>R</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>Lisp</li>
      </div>
      <p>I have completed several coding projects that have challenged me to think outside the box. One of my favorite has been my cross-disciplinary dive into exoplanet hunting in deep space. Click <a href="Henry_Gardner_Software_Project_Sample.pdf">here</a> to see a more in depth look into this project that I created. </p>
      <p>I love the Lob desire towards excellence and how closley and tight-knit your values "anchor" your everyday life. It has been my dream to work in a diverse and highly-collaborative enviornment like Lob. I want to develop software that is bold. I want to make things that helps businesses and people. I want to work along side like-minded people that strive towards excellence. I am very excited for this opportunity and I want to thank you for your time and consideration!</p>
