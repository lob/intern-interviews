      <p> Hello! I am currently a Computer Science major at Haverford College in my junior year. </p>
      <p>At this internship, I hope to be exposed to the professional software development process. To me, software engineering means attention to detail. Good software can easily be brought down by poorly crafted, difficult to use interfaces that turn away users. Inversely, buggy, poorly tested software will render the best UI's useless. At Lob, I anticipate the opportunity to be put in a challenging team environment where I can hone my skills creating polished software.</p>
        
      <p>Personally, I enjoy creating software that involves a visual or interactive element. Being able to watch algorithms and data structures operate is a source of satisfaction for me when coding. As a result, many of my projects incorporate a visual element. The opportunity to get both fronteend and back-end experience at this internship appeals to me for this reason. </p>
