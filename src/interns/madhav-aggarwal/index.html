      <p>Hi, I'm Madhav! Above you see Zürich, Switzerland. I've been calling Zürich home for the last 9 years and counting. While I'm now in the U.S. studying CS+Econ at UIUC, this picture will always remain meaningful to me. </p>
      <p>During an internship at Lob, I'd be really interested in learning how to build robust and scalable backend systems, like those you currently use to digitize and automate print mail sending. The sheer scale of impact you can have motivates me to be a software engineer - I witnessed this firsthand at my previous internship at MealMe (as a Backend SWE), where algorithms I created still help thousands of users find the best daily delivery deals.</p>
      <p>To close, I'd just like to extend my appreciation for this creative (and practical) assessment format as opposed to regular coding challenges.</p>
