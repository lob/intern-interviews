          Self-introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
          A motivated and personable student pursuing a MS in Software
          Engineering at San Jose State University. Iâ€™m looking for an
          internship where I can utilize my experience with full-stack website
          development, object-oriented programming, design patterns and
          algorithms and cooperate with your software developers to improve
          application performance.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Expection in an internship
        </h3>
        <p>
          I would like to learn how a software engineer should perform in actual
          enterprise environment rather than campus. It would be great to get
          familiar with the process of developing a software in enterprise
          environment.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Why do I want to be a software engineer
        </h3>
        <p>
          I love solving problems, especially in coding. It would make me
          self-satified if I just finished a project after analizing, dividing,
          conquering and perfecting it. I have experience with many full-stack
          projects, including LEMP and MERN stack. Interest pushs me to move
          forward when doing these projects, but I am really curious about how
          it works in enterprise environment.
