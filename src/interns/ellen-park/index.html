      <p>Hi, I’m Ellen Park. I’m a recent graduate from the Flatiron School’s immersive software engineering program and a former technical designer in the fashion industry. My love for problem solving and eye for detail allowed me to excel at technical design. However, my true passion is coding. With coding, I’ve found a happy balance between creative problem solving, my need for organization and love for efficiency.</p>
      <p>There are countless skills that I hope to gain through this internship. For starters, the applications I’ve built up until this point only handle small volumes of traffic. Because of that, I’m particularly motivated to learn more about developing large, scalable systems while still maintaining high levels of security for users. In addition, I’m extremely eager to gain more experience working with a remote team of engineers.</p>
      <p>If given this opportunity I would be thrilled to contribute to the development of innovative software that is revolutionizing direct mail communications.</p>
