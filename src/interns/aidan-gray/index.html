      <p> During this internship, I would like to learn more about the software development process relative to the commercial world, as well as what it's like to work on a team of professional engineers. Ultimately I'd like to become a software engineer because I have an obsession with complex problem solving. The first time I truly felt challenged during my academic career was during my first semester post-transfer from city college. Last spring, I took a junior-level Data Structures and Algorithms course that constantly pushed my intrigue and efforts. The professor's grading method for the course was to have weekly quizzes, and rather than have regular exams, we were given five assignments throughout the semester with roughly two-and-a-half weeks to complete each. Upon receiving each of my assignments, for the first time in my schooling, I would get to work ASAP to tackle the initially insurmountable problems. They were completely addicting. I finished the semester with 100% in that course, knowing instantly that I would enroll in that professor's senior-level elective Algorithms course. Being tasked with gordian knots and cutting through them is what I look forward to doing for the rest of my professional life. Currently, my interests lie in computer security applications as well as AI and ML.</p>
