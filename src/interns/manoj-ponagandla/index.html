          Most of the technology that we are developing today is focused on
          making lives easier and comfortable. While this is true in many cases,
          there are a few where technology is complicating things for many
          people. Direct mail is one such area, and you, the Lob team, are
          focusing on solving that problem. Lob's motive to bridge the gap
          between traditional mail and modern businesses is fascinating. I would
          love to contribute to this mission in a way I could. By that I mean,
          working as a Software Developer at Lob.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always carried a purpose-driven mentality and get highly inspired by
          such missions. That is one of the reasons why I want to work with you.
          Being a software engineer in this software era, where a piece of code
          can connect multiple pieces of a puzzle to solve a problem, My
          motivation is to look for those problems and contribute to the
          solutions and make the world a better place.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I addressed these professional reasons, Lob's ethical concern
          towards the environment is a significant factor that influenced me. I
          am highly particular when it comes to the planet's eco-system. I
          changed my lifestyle in a great way to reduce my carbon footprint as
          much as possible. By working with the Lob team, I want to use my
          knowledge in various skills to help improve the product, and also gain
          more expertise in the areas I already excel in, all while being
          equally responsible to the life on the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          At last, I am personally connected to the blue color accent across the
          company's visual assets. Yes, I love the color Blue, and I only
          realized that in a funny way. That's a story I'm hoping to get to
          share with you soon.
