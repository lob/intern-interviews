    Hi,
    This is Nishant Sapkota. I am a CS major at WMU in Kalamazoo, Mi. Check out my cool app that
    I built using MERN stack.https://blog-aappp.herokuapp.com/. This is running on node in the
    backend and in react in the frontend with mongoDB (fav db) as the databse. At this internship, I wanna
    gain the industry experience as a software engineer from all the professional developers you have in your
    firm.
