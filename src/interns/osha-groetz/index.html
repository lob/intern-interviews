        <h3>What do I want to learn during an internship</h3> 
        Not just any internship, but specifically the internship at Lob: I would be excited to have the opportunity to work with and learn from seasoned engineers.  
        The internship would give me the experience of learning your stack. I want to learn as much as I can to grow into an incredible engineer, all the while improving my development patterns and writing clean, DRY code.

        <h3>What makes me want to be a Software Engineer</h3>
        Everyday, since I started at the beginning of last year, I have learned something new in coding.  I find this aspect of being a developer the most intriguing.  
        On a broader scale, I know I want to help people, and I believe that being an Engineer, I can do this in a large, scalable way.  One of the things I can't wait to do in programming is to help teach other women/girls how to code.

        <h3>What sorts of software would I like to create</h3>
        I want to build software that helps other businesses be more successful, helping them with certain aspects so that they can focus on doing what they do best.  
        It would also be incredible to work on software that helps everyone work, live, educate, etc. from home as our world has changed so rapidly and as it continues to become even more remote
