      <p> Hi, I am Pranitha. I am pursuing Master of Science in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.Recently I have been offered with teaching assistantship for a graduate course in our university. I have maintained a GPA of 3.83.</p>
      <p>I discovered my interest in programming during my under graduation. Since then, I have been immersed in solving problems using code. In college.I have always been an enthusiastic to learn different programming languages and technologies like</p>

      <p>I have done a lot of projects as part of academics, one of my favorite project is "Personal Budget". Click <a href="https://personalbudget-frontend.herokuapp.com/">here</a> to view</p>
      <p>In the future, I want to become a software engineer. After reading about your internship program at LOB, many of your values—such as long-term growth and investing in your employees—resonated with me deeply. I also think that your workplace would be a great place for me to develop hands-on professional experience solving difficult problem in the assigned projects and if given any assignments that I must complete and  I expect to learn the skills which the intern is expected to master and improve my coding skills on success or failure.Also working in teams make me interact with other teammates and I would always be happy to learn from other. </p>
