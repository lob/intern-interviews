      <p> Hi, I am Pranitha. I am pursuing Master of Science in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. As an Intern, I may be usually assigned to certain projects and are given certain assignments that I must complete but I expect to have a great deal of freedom, work may be divided up based on my interest and skills,managers encourage team work so shareing what I do not want to do with some one who does want to do it. I expect to learn the skills which the intern is expected to master each month and report on success or failure. </p>
