        <p>Hello! My name is Aaron Ballmer and on the left is a picture of my dog, Murphy, and I. I was first introduced to coding in high school and the puzzle solving nature of CS really caught my attention. I enjoyed it much more than the other work I did in high school and this led to me becoming a CS major in college. </p>
        <p>I have loved getting to learn more about CS and computers in general over the past 4 years, and my interest in CS has only grown since then. Having two internships under my belt, I have an idea of what I look for in an internship and what has been very beneficial to me. There are many different things to learn from an internship but two of the main ones for me have been getting to learn more about different companies and learning from the people an intern gets to work with over the summer. </p>
        <p>It is fascinating to me to get the opportunity to ask questions to co-workers, mentors, and even fellow interns about the company itself. Getting the chance to learn in depth about the company itself along with learning more about the industry is very valuable and there is so much that I have learned that I wouldnâ€™t have found from looking on the internet.</p>
        <p>It is also so vital to me to learn from co-workers about a wide variety of things. There are so many smart, experienced people in the world and being able to use them as resources is so amazing. I had no experience working with React or Javascript coming into my first internship and I was able to glean so much from my co-workers and the same goes for last summer as well. I truly believe I am a much better dev than I would have been had I not had these two previous experiences.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I have realized that I want to create and work on software that makes a difference in peoples lives. I am still new and am figuring out what I want to do over the course of my career, however, from applying to jobs over the past two years, it has come to me that I want to work on something meaningful, exciting, and important to those using the software.</p>
