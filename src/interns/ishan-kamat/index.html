        I'm a
        <span class="green">programmer</span>,
        tech enthusiast, <span class="blue">Rice</span> student,
        <span class="cyan">Arch Linux</span>
        user, vexillologist, novice cook, and an applicant to your wonderful company.
        My language of choice is <span class="blue">Python</span>,
        and I'm also versed in <span class="magenta">C</span> and <span class="red">Java</span> (especially for <span class="green">Android</span> apps).
        I have some experience with <span class="orange">HTML</span>/<wbr><span class="blue">CSS</span>/<wbr><span class="yellow">JS</span>/<wbr><span class="cyan">jQuery</span>, and I've used <span class="green">Vue</span>, <span class="red">Materialize</span>, and <span class="magenta">PHP</span>/<wbr><span class="blue">WordPress</span>.

        I want to be a software engineer because I like writing code. It's wonderful to be able to type out instructions that can control each aspect and every detail of a webpage, mobile app, operating system, or anything else.
        In applying for this internship, I'm looking for an experience like this: I hope to find an environment where people are focused on building tools that rethink the fundamentals, question the things that are taken for granted,
        and implement technologies in a breakthrough way. I hope to grow as a coder and as an intellectual person in this atmosphere, and I want to contribute to a team where every member cares about what they do. I'm convinced that
        I can realize this dream at Lob: I want to work alongside people who are developing infrastructure that forms the backbone of communication in industry. This stuff really matters: it's important to the world. I want to be a
        part of that.
