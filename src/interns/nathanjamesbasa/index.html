      <p> During an internship, I would want to learn how tools, practices, and programming languages encompass software engineering. Specifically with Lob, I am interested in building and utilizing new APIs and technologies to make people's lives easier. I would like to create application software ranging anywhere in the stack, yet I am open to challenging myself wherever possible. My research and project experience has allowed me to learn about the heights that APIs, such as speech APIs, can reach. That is one of the excitements I have about potentially working with Lob. I am also interested in getting to meet the team members and learn about each of them. The reason that I want to be a software engineer is the interesting combination of technology, teamwork, and iteration that goes into creating applications and projects. In a broad sense, I want to help other people live happier and more efficient lives.</p>
