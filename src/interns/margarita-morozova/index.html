        <div class="divider">Why Software Engineering</div>
        <p>I have a background in Education and Business Administration, but I have always been fascinated by coding and computer science in general. Last year I decided it was time to make a career change and software engineering felt like the natural next step. Flatironâ€™s 15-week immersive bootcamp allowed me to sharpen my skills to a professional level and showed me that I can learn anything in record time if I feel passionate about it.</p>
        <p>I feel like being a software engineer gives me a superpower to influence the world. I love to work on projects I believe in. I always feel more strongly motivated in my work when I feel as though I am helping to make the world a better place. I have a good eye for design and user experience, I enjoy making eye-catching, efficient and easily accessible software, starting with the ideal user experience and working backwards. </p>
        <div class="divider">Why the Internship</div>
        <p>I look forward to gaining some valuable experience from this internship. I want to learn how to work in a real-world environment not just the academic world. I am really excited about the opportunity to collaborate with other software engineers whom I can learn from. </p>
        <p>I believe I would be a good match for this internship. My problem-solving abilities allow me to work extremely well under pressure. I like to challenge myself, one of my favorite things about the tech industry is the culture of innovation and discovery. I am very excited about learning new programming languages and tools. Also, I would love to share my creativity and bring fresh ideas into my team. </p>
