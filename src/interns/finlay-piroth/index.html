                <p>
                    A lot of my past experience lies in mobile development, which I did not really choose for it to be that way it's just how things worked out based on the opportunities I got.
                    At Lob, I want to learn all about the backend of the internet and what goes on behind the scenes. Specifically, I would love to work on the Address Verification API, since I have never worked on an API before and would love to learn how through hands-on learning.
                    I would also like to improve my web development skills -- I know a lot of React and some Node, but I would like to know more about how to fit web technologies together into one product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't say what type of software engineer I want to be. There are so many different kinds and I'm still in college so I haven't really gotten the chance to explore careers in differnt areas of software engineering.
                    The only area that I still don't know much about that I might want to do as a career is cyber security, which I am hoping to learn about in a tech elective next quarter or in my last year at cal poly.
                    But honestly, anywhere with fun people to work with and where I can make a comfortable living I would be happy regardless of what I'm doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, I want to create software that will change the world for the better. A lot of the programming I have done has been for non-profits, and seeing their purpose and mission first hand has made me realize
                    that the best kind work is work where you are helping others. So hopefully some day I have the skills to make the world a better place, however that may be.
