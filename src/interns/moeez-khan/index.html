      <p> For my 11th birthday, I received a personal laptop as it was something that I really wanted. Ever since, I was obsessed with technology. In doing simple things such as surfing the web or typing into notepad, I became tremendously curious about the “how?”. I wanted to know how software like web browsers, text editors, etc. are made. From there, I strived to research this question and learn everything I can to answer it.</p>
      <p> I started by teaching myself the fundamentals of HTML and made various fun websites for me and my friends. I then taught myself Visual Basic as my first programming language and made countless software from YouTube videos and other resources I could find. Then I branched out to learning some of the fundamentals of C++ and C#. </p>
      <p> My experiences as a kid are the reason why I want to become a Software Engineer. Computer Science is my passion and I want to explore the field and learn as much as possible. I believe that Lob would provide a fantastic opportunity for me to utilize my skills, further my knowledge, and learn new things.</p>
