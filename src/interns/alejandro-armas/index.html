        First I would like to say I enjoyed this application a lot, it was pretty fun and a unique idea! 

    </p>
    <p> The picture I chose is one of my family. My parents immigrated from a small town in Mexico never having learned english nor passed primary school and nowadays struggle from the challenges of being undocumented,
       wage stagnation and the housing crisis in the Bay Area. All that's to say is that each day I debug code or struggle trying to understand a concept is a constant reminder I have "no business" in computing, but I persist since I 
      absolutely love programming in spite of being introduced so late. My short term goals are to support my family with this lucrative profession and long term to be able to provide social mobility for others of my background.    
    </p>

    <p> 
      I can't promise I'm the greatest programmer, but I'm very curious about understanding things at a deep level, I'm willing to put the extra effort 
      and I'm constantly trying to improve myself as a communicator in a working environment.       
   </p>

   <p> 
    I think a relevent project you would like to see is one which I programmed in Javascript titled <a href="https://manololandscaping.herokuapp.com/">Manolo Landscaping</a>.
     I will warn you, I used the free tier on Heroku so the webapp has to un-idle. After working on so much plain Javascript and CSS, I defintely know I prefer backend haha!
