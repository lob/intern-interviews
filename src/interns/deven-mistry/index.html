      <p> Hello I'm Deven. I have always been the go-to-guy in my family who fixes tech, be it computers, mobile phones, etc. This inquisitive nature kept me motivated throughout my undergrad, which led me to pursue my Masters here at the University of Cincinnati. I am currently pursuing my thesis in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and I plan to graduate in Summer 2021. </p>

      <p>
        Individual I have always been a great believer of the ideology of Earn, Learn and Grow. From this internship, I would like to bring my technical internships at table which would help the organization and it would also help me grow professionally. I wish to create a significant impact from my internship and learn as much as I can. </p>

      <p>As a software developer, I enjoy creating web applications and work with machine learning algorithms and study the advances in deep learning. 	</p>
