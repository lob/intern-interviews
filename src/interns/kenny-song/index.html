      <p> I have always had passion for problem solving and tackling challenges of the unknown. To name drop a few accomplishments: I ran a marathon with no training, I started my own restaurant at the age of 23 (also with no management/ cooking experience), and created a full stack application in 3 months. I naturally had a predisposition for wanting to solve interesting problems, so I pursued a biomedical engineering degree in college. However, I did not find much passion for this particular subject. Post graduation, I bounced to different industries, working as a marketing consultant, a restaurant owner, and eventually an analyst for Apple. Once I was able to get an insider scoop into the tech scene, my <span class='bold'>React</span>ion was completely <span class='bold'>Hook</span>ed. Seeing an abstraction of seemingly random sequences of characters come to life as a product that people used completely mesmerized me and made me want to take the leap forward.</p>
      <p> As a software intern, I want to continue solving unique problems and chasing that thrill of being able to get something to finally work exactly the way itâ€™s supposed to. As much as I learn throughout the internship experience, I want to give back in terms of production, work, creativity, mentorship, or any form of tangible value. I truly feel like I have found my true passion and I want to be able to share all of that with the fellow interns and all of Lob.</p>
