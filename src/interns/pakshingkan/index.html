                <p>Hi, this is Pak. </p> 
                <p>I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at San Jose State University. I am a highly motivated software engineer with main focus on web development.</p>
                <p> I wish I can learn more about the web development and how to work with a team professonally.</p>
                <p> It would be nice that I would have a mentor to guide me throughout the internship program. </p>
                <p>I know I don't have a lot of working experience but as a person who loves challenges. I am excited to learn from you guys and enhance my skillsets to a professonal level.</p>
                <p> I had created some personal projects while I was self-taughting myself web dev.</p>  
                <p>Please come and visit my latest personal project => <a href="https://travel-log.pakshing.vercel.app/"> Travel Log </a></p>
                <p>I was majoring in civil engineering before. However, I got attracted to the world of programming. There are always new technologies that allow me to utilize for making better products. I love how you can use only a laptop with the knowledge of programming to build pretty much anything you want. My dream is to build something that is meaningful to our world, something that really can help people.</p>
