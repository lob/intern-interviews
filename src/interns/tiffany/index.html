        <p>
          I'm a gal that loves learning, growing, and challenging myself everyday. I knew if I were to enter the field
          of software engineering that I would be doing exactly that while also getting to exercise my problem solving
          skills and creativity. I believe in the power of technology and really want to use it to make a difference in
          people's lives so they can focus on what really matters!
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm excited to apply for a software engineering internship at Lob and would love the chance to collaborate
          with the innovative problem solvers there. I am interested in building intuitive and user friendly
          interfaces with Lob and would like to develop my React skills in a real world setting. The intersection of
          design and engineering interests me greatly as well (I created the background image myself inspired by Lob's own lobster!) and thus I would love to participate in creating wireframes and mockups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I would like to learn how to create scalable systems that can accomodate a lot of requests at
          once, which I'm sure Lob knows a lot about. Most of the projects I've made are small, so I haven't had to
          worry about that, but it would be a great learning experience so that in the future I can implement
          scalability in upcoming projects. I'm looking forward to hearing back from Lob!
