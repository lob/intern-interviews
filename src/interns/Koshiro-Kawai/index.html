                <p>Hello, My name is Koshiro and I'm a third year computer science student at CSU East Bay.
                    With my interest in backend and frontend using node and react, I would love to learn the intricacies
                    of a modern production level api.
                    I also want to learn a new tech stack that I'm not familiar with and get out of my comfort zone of
                    using javascript frameworks.
                    I want to be a software engineer to tackle new problems that are challenging to me that can
                    positvely
                    affect others. </p>
