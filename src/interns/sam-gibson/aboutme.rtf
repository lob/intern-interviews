\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello, my name is Sam Gibson; I am a student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am looking for an internship that requires me to learn many new skills. I am also interested in understanding what the infrastructure of a company looks like and how collaboration is being used to efficiently solve problems. I\'92m interested in algorithmic complexity, so most of the software I want to write relates to efficient algorithms on big data.}
