      <p> Hi Lobsters! My name is Justin Bao, and I'm currently a junior at the University of Washington pursuing a dual degree
        in Computer Science and Informatics. Ever since I was 6 years old, I've been fascinated by technology and how I could use
        inject my own personality and creativity into technology. I've always been fascinated with technology's potential to solve
        the world's problems in ways previous unimaginable through rapid computation and modern innovation. Each of my previous
        internships and projects have only amplified this desire to learn about new levels of capabilities and efficiency 
        through software as I began to work with larger-scale projects that impacted more people. Specifically, my experience last
        summer at the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrated to me how much room there is for tech to take over for outdated and obsolete
        methods for solving problems that society has relied on for decades.
      </p>
        
      <p>In an Software Engineering Internship with Lob, I'd be
        interested in learning more about how I can utilize my own skills to contribute to a modern perspective on a traditional 
        problem, such as Lob's focus on automating direct mail and address verification. I'm also extremely interested in learning
        more about how distributed systems and cloud computing can be utilized to push the frontier of innovation, especially after
        exposure to interesting distributed tech environments in previous internships. Lastly, I'd be beyond excited to get the
        chance to contribute to an up-and-coming tech company and learn as much as I can about building software with the mindset of
        helping as many people as possible.
