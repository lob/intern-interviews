          I want to be more proficient technically and hope the internship is fast paced, demanding, collaborative,
          and a great learning experience. I'm inspired to make software because I believe it is the strongest force
          in making society a fairer and more just place. I believe Bitcoin is likely the next world reserve currency
          so I'd like to work with Bitcoin in someway. Close seconds.. perhaps with some overlap - Data science/ML, cloud computing, VR/AR.
