        One of the main reasons I want to be a software engineer is the thrill of solving problems through code, conjuring new technological solutions. My past internship experiences have taught me that 
        applying concepts I have learned in the classroom is the best way to gain even more knowledge, as I have found that hands-on work is my favorite educational tool. As an intern at Lob, I plan to give
        110% of my effort into any and every task assigned to me with the mindset to absorb information and contribute as much as I can. I hope to further develop my strengths, including SQL, Python, and
        Node.js, tools I have used extensively in the past, as well as explore the vast number of applications and features of the Lob APIs. I am particularly interested in creating software that uses
        these APIs in new and creative ways. <br><br>
        In addition to my interest in coding and computer science, here are some other facts about me that you may not get from my resume:<br>
        I am an avid sports fan and love to get into statistics and data relating to the sports world.<br>
        I play the guitar.<br>
        I love to snowboard and ski.
