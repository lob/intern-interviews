        <h4>SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h4>
        <div class="line-break"></div>
        <p>As a bootcamp graduate, I am eager to test my skills at a professional level. 
            I want to learn how to better plan and execute production, 
            communicate more effectively, and work with a team on a shared goal. Ultimately, I want to 
            further develop my technical skills and have the opportunity to grow and challenge myself. 
        </p>
        <p>My journey to becoming a software engineer began after coming across a <em>Web Developer</em> job posting 
            and researching what it entailed. I quickly became fascinated by the thought of being able to bring 
            ideas to life through web applications. I would love to create software applications that can help 
            people in their day to day lives, like an inventory tracking app for businesses, or a doctor's appointment booking app.
