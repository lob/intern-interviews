          Hi! I want to start off by saying I am extremely excited to submit
          myself for this internship, I am hoping to gain experience working in
          a production environment as well as getting mentored by a senior
          developer. I am a very curious individual who loves learning new
          things.

          I graduated from App Academy's Software Engineering Immersive Program
          in August 2020. For as long as I can remember I been passionate about
          technology and fitness, I initially pursued a career in fitness as a
          personal trainer but it wasn't until I decided to learn to code in
          hopes of building my own fitness program that I felt like I found my
          true calling. I remember the excitement the first time that I logged
          to the console, the excitement the first time I rendered a page using
          localhost, these are memories that will forever live with me.
