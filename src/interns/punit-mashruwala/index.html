      <p> Hello! My name is Punit Mashruwala, I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University
        of North Carolina at Charlotte. </p>
      <p> I have previous work experience of 3 years as a Software Developer at Capiot Private Software Limited where my
        primary focus was building REST-API services with help of NodeJS. During my 3 years at Capiot I had worked with
        Travel based and E-commerce based clients. I am also familiar with Spring Boot, AngularJS, Python, JavaScript,
        Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, MySQL, GitHub, Android Development (Java). </p>
      <p> My interest in developing REST-API started when I started to work on NodeJS and creatingÂ  REST-API for a Travel base MDM system. And after seeing the job description of Lob, I would like to learn more about creating REST-API using different technologies for supporting applications like Mail services and Address verification for the offline world. I would love to learn more about the system in more dept.</p>

      <p> My hobby is playing cricket and I try to follow most of the matches around the world. My favourite Cricket
        Player is Virat Kholi and I used to Idolized Rahul Dravid. They are both from India. </p>
