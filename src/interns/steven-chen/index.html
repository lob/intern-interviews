      <p>My interest in computer science was first born from the many hours I spent doing photography and editing photos on Adobe Photoshop, which sparked my interest in software programs. I was amazed by the power of technology to transform media and art. Today, Iâ€™m able to bridge the gap between design and programming, and feel comfortable managing not only the code of a program, but also the UX/UI frontend design and product development phases. Ultimately, I enjoy combining my programming skills with my background in digital media to create elegant software solutions. Regarding the types of software I would like to build at Lob: I'm interested in frontend development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a framework (Angular, Vue, React, etc.), but I'm definitely open to building data-based programs or related backend applications in Python or Ruby as well! My short-term goal is to become a full-stack developer, while long-term, I hope to design more applications within data science, computer vision, and deep learning.</p>
