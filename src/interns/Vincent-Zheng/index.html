      <p> Hello, I'm Vincent and I'm currently a junior studying computer science at the University at Buffalo. 
        In highschool I've had a chance to take some computer science electives that taught me about the various fields and possibilities
      that it contained. So, coming into college I knew I wanted to major in computer science. As a computer scienctist its always best to work smarter not harder
    and I think that also reflects what type of software I would like to create. That being programs that allow people to work more
    efficiently and effectively . Like many others coming into this internship I would like to gain valuable experience. I would also like to apply the skills  that I have been  learning 
  and see how productive I can be. However, most importantly I want to learn all the things that only hands experience can teach you.</a>   </p>
