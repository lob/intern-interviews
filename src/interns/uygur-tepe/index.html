      <p> During an internship I want to be able to learn new skills such as new technologies 
        while having a symbiotic relationship with the company I’m working for. Some technologies 
        I want to learn and further develop are my API and backend development skills. I'd also
        be very interested in diving into the frontend world such as working with a modern 
        Javascript framework such as React or Vue. 
      </p>
      <p> I am attracted to the field of Software engineering as I have passion for problem 
        solving and impacting people's everyday lives. The internet and websites are things 
        society interacts with every single day so I enjoy working with web development 
        technologies as they have a direct impact and benefit to society. Currently I primarily
        have developed APIs and backend services, looking to the future I’d like to be able to create 
        a full web application which would be able to serve at least one person in their day to day 
        needs by solving an issue they were facing.
