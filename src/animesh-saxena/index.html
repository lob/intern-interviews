      <p>Significance of the Picture</p>
      <p>We worked the whole day and finally went to eat. And boy did we eat. This is just one of the authentic moments that have been captured on camera where me and my friends are having a great time just hanging out and eating. (btw, I'm the one on the top left, who has food in his mouth and is wanting more)</p>

      <p> The opportunity to do hard work at work worth doing. The past two months, stuck at a place due to the lockdown I was feeling a bit fatigued and generally down. I was told by my mother to help an aged artist sell his paintings online. So I accepted the job and met him. He had hundreds of paintings. For each painting, we had to take a photo and brush it up using adobe photoshop. Then I created a simple website using html, css and php which just displays each painting and allows the person to email if interested in one painting. </p>
      <p> Technologically speaking, this wasnt the hardest or most interesting project. There was no logic to be appreciated or an algorithm to be beautiful, which I generally love. It was purely functional and did a job. But this is the project which is my favorite. The leg work of taking each photo in the correct light and manually brushing it up is one of the things I can be proud of. This is because of the impact and the type of work. It was to help someone and that is why I loved it. </p>
      <p> Post this realization, I tried to help plumbers and electricians by automating few systems. You can read about it in my resume. But what I want from this internship and from my career as a Software Developer is having a direct impact at making lives easier and helping people. And that is the reason I want to become a Lobster. To gain that opportunity.</p>
